1. Form the possessive singular of nouns with 's
    - Charles's friend

2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.
    - read, white, and blue
    - honest, energetic, but headstrong
    - He opened the letter, read it and made a note of its contents
    - blue, etc.

3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas
    - The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.
    - Marjorie's husband, Colonel Nelson, paid us a visit yesterday.
    - My brother, you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health.
    - The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more and more interested.

    In these sentences the clauses are non-restrictive. Each sentence is a combination of two statments which might have been made independently.

    Restrictive relative clauses are not set off by commas.
    - The candidate who best meets these requirements will obtain the place.

4. Place a comman before and or but introducing an independent clause.
    - The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.
    - As the early records of the city have disappeared, the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed. 重写后的句子，更能表达出因果关系

5. 不要使用逗号连接独立子句
    - Stevenson's romances are entertaining; they are full of exciting adventrues.
    - It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.

    如果第二个子句的前面是副词，如accordingly, besides, so, then, therefore, or thus, 而不是连接词, 应该使用分号。 
    - I had never been in the place before; so I had difficulty in finding my way about.
    一般不会这样使用so，因为这样很容易导致so的过多使用，可以使用as替代:
    - As I had never been in the place before, I had difficulty in finding my way about.
    如果子句很短，逗号是可用的
    - Man proposes, God disposes.

6. 不要打断句子
    - I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago, coming home from Liverpool to New York.

7. 分词

    - 双字母 Apen-nines refer-ring tell-ing
    - 音节 for-tune pic-ture

一个subject 需要分为多个topics, 每个topic一段。

10. 每一段开头概括主题，结尾呼应主题。

11. 使用主动
    - I shall always remember my first visit to Bostion. 更好
    - My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.
