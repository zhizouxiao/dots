###3. how to writing effective sentences?

Short simple sentences grab the reader's attention and add emphasis.
eg. Living only 3km away from the University on a main bus route, he was able to get to his lecture in just 15 minutes.

Compound sentences can emphasise balance and parallel ideas.
eg. I decided to have a gap year before starting my degree course, but most of my firends went straight to university.

Complex sentences show what information depends on what other information.
eg. If England keep on playing in the same manner, they won't win the World Cup.
