1. /I/ and /i/
Remember to relax your tongue and lips for the /I/ sound and to make them tense for the /i/ sound.

2. /ɛ/ and /æ/
Remember that for the /æ/ sound the jaw is more open, and the tongue is down at the floorof your mouth. For the /ɛ/ sound, the jaw is just slightly down.

3. /ʊ/ and /u/
Remember, /ʊ/ is a relaxed sound, with the lips almost neutral, just very slightly rounded. By contrast /u/ is a tense sound. The lips are rounded and tense.
