#### Clauses
1. defining relative clause
The part of the sentence that gives the information about the person or thing.  
eg: The man who lent me the book.  
The book which I borrowed.

2. Which relative pronoun must we use?
    - for people: who, that, whose, whom.  
    eg. the man who/that lent me the book.  
    the man whose book I borrowed.  
    the man from whom I borrowed the book. (very formal)  
    the man whom I borrowed the book from. (less formal)  
    the man who I borrowed the book from. (modern spoken english, informal)

    - for objects: which, that, whose  
    eg. the book which/ that I borrowed.  
    the book which/that is entitled 'Peace'.

    - for places, times and reason: where, when, why, that  
    eg.  
    the library where we met. (informal)  
    the library at which we met. (formal)  
    the day when/that we met. (informal)  
    the day on which we met. (formal)  
    the reason why/that I was at the library (informal)  
    the reason for which I was at the library (formal)

3. Can we drop the relative pronoun? 
    - A: In formal written English, it is best not to drop it.   
    In informal and spoken English. it is common to drop it, but it is not possible.
    - can drop if the information is related to the 'object' of the sentence,
    but not when it is the 'subject'.  
    eg.   
    the man who/that lent me the book.  
    the book which/that is called 'subject'.  
    the man (who/whom) I borrowed the book from.  
    the book (which/that) I borrowed.  
    - cannot drop 'whom' when it is next to the preposition  
    eg.  
    the man from whom I borrowed the book.
    - cannot drop 'whose', 'of which' or 'where'
    eg.  
    the man whose book I borrowed.  
    the book the title of which is 'Peace'  
    the library where I met him.
    - can drop 'when' and 'why' in the same way you can drop 'that':
    the day (when/that) I met him.
    the reason (why/that) I was at the library.

4. How about 'what' and 'how'?
    - 'what' and 'how' is not relative pronouns because they cannot come after a noun.  
    what = the thing which eg. What I read in the book surprised me.  
    how = the matter in which eg. I still remember how we met.

5. non-defining relative clause
    - it gives addtional information. if we eliminate this information from the sentence, the listener still knows who or what we are talking about.  
    In written English, there is a comma before a non-defining relative clause.  
    eg.  
    The man who lent me the book was the auther himself, who you may have heard of.  
    The book which I borrowed, which you may have read, is entitled 'Peace'.  
    The library where we met, where I always borrow books, is the largest in the city.  
    The man who/that lent me the book was the auther himself, which was totally amazing.  
    - you cannot use 'that' instead of 'who' or 'which' in non-defining relative clause.
