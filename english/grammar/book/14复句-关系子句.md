关系子句的连接词是子句中内涵字眼的改写，而名词子句与副词子句的连接词都是外加的。

    - I know that I am right.
    - I know this because I have proof.
    - I don't trust people who talk too much.

省略连接词

    - the man [whom] you saw just now is my uncle. 可以省略
    - the man who was here just now is my uncle. 不可省略(主词)

何时使用that？that 具有指示功能。关系子句如果有指示的作用时才适合借用that。

    - Man is an animal that is capable of reason.
    - Meteorology is a science that deals with the behavior of the atmosphere.
    - I like TIMES, which many people like, too. 不适合that

先行词的省略

    - What: I have [the thing] what you need.
    - Whoever: I'll shoot whoever moves.
    - Whicohever: I'll take whichever car you like.
    - When: I know when he will arrive.
    - Where: The car stopped where three roads met.
    - how/why: I've forgotten why I called.


有逗号的关系子句, 不能用that替代，也不能省略

    - Shakespeare was born in 1564, when Queen Elizabeth I was on the throne.
    - The best museum in Taiwan is the Palace Museum, where you can see our national treasures.
