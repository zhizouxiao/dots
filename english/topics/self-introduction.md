Good morning/noon/evening everybody. Thank you for inviting me for this interview or giving me an opportunity today to tell about myself. My name is "Yang Kang" and I am from China. I am born and brought up in China. I am looking for an opportunity to build my career and enhance technical skills too.

I am studying in Beihang university and I will be graduating this month. At the university, I have joined a lot of co-curricular activities and like to make lot of friends. I am the narrator of the Beihang school museum and it has given me really good experience and also increased my communication skill. 

In 2013, I worked in Accenture as a consultant for about 4 months. During this period, I have designed a web system for the China national petroleum to improve the management of the petroleum input and output. I took part in some designing tasks like the interface of the system and flow chart. From this internship, I got in depth knowledge of business ideas. More than that, I learned how to work in a team and how to deal with multiple things.
(You can add more points on your skills like software or management tools  used etc.)

Apart from the learning and internship, I like playing basketball. It is an effective way to keep young and healthy. Thank you!

3. Example
My name is Elie. I am graduate from huahang university. senior high school and major in computer. There are four people in my family. My father works in a computer company. And my mother is a housewife. I am the youngest one in my family.â€¨In my spare time, I like to read novels. I think reading could enlarge my knowledge. As for novels, I could imagine whatever I like such as a well-known scientist or a kung-fu master. In addition to reading, I also like to play PC games. A lot of grownups think playing PC games hinders the students from learning. But I think PC games could motivate me to learn something such as English or Japanese.My favorite course is English because I think it is interesting to say one thing via different sounds. I wish my English could be improved in the next four years and be able to speak fluent English in the future.
