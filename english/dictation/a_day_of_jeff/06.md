On the way to the office, I was thinking about what I have on my agenda today. 

When I get to my desk, there are a stack of new memos and papers in my inbox.

When I turn on my computer, I see at least two-dozen of emails that I need to go through.

Just as I `start in on my email`, my phone rings.

It's my project manager, Julie, asking fme to come in for a conference call with our head office.

I don't get back to my desk for nearly two hours.

By that time, I was ready for a break.

At 10:30 I head down to break room and get some hot water `at the water cooler` to make some tea.

There were a couple of other people on break, having snacks out of the `vending machine` and reading the new notices on the `bulletinboard`.

I run into Sam, one of my friends at work, and we chat a little before going back to work.

Before long, it is time for lunch. I usually bring my lunch with me to work, and eat it at my desk.

If I don't have time to pack a lunch, I sometimes go across the street for some `take-out`. 

The only trouble is, it's always so busy during the lunch hour, and I always have to stand in line. That's usually a pain.

On Fridays, I usually go out to lunch with a few friends from work. On causal Friday, we can kick back a little and take it easy.
