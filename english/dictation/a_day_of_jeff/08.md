When I get home, I start on dinner right away. 

I clean off the `kitchen counter` after putting away the `groceries` and decide to make `pasta`. I preheat the oven to 375 to bake the bread, and to keep the chicken hot until my wife gets home. 

I put some water in the pan and `turn the burner on high`.

When the water starts boiling, I put in the pasta. And decide to make a salad.

Just then, my wife opens the back door and yells, "I'm home."

She comes into the kitchen and helps with `chopping` the tomatos to add to the sauce.

She `stirs` the sauce until it's done, while I finish `tossing the salad`.

I get out the `plate mats and napkins` to set the table. I also make sure there is a spoon, knife, fork and plate for each of us.

About 15 minutes later, we sit down at the table in the `dining room`, and talk about our long day.

My wife says she will do the dishes, since I cooked. But of course, I help out by drying them.

First, I put some `leftovers` in a `Tupperware container`, and some in `plastic wrap`, and the rest in the `aluminum foil`. Then I dry the pans, plates, glasses and `silverware`.
