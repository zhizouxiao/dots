I walk into my kitchen and turn on the `coffeemaker`. 

I always put the coffee, filter, and water in the night before so it's ready to go.

Next day I open the door of the `cupboard` where the `cereal` is stored.

I would love to have `ham and eggs` for breakfast every morning,

or maybe a stack of `waffles`, but the truth is that I just don't have time to cook.

So, I pour myself a `bowl of cereal` and put in a glass of `skim milk`,

`making sure I take a spoon out of the silverware tray`.

I go outside and pick up my newspaper, and sit down at the kitchen table.

I love reading the paper in the morning, though usually I just have time to read a few of stories.

when I finish my cereal, I grab a banana and maybe make a slice of toast with jam. 

I `rinse off` my breakfast dishes in the sink, and put them in the dishwasher.

By that time, my coffee is ready so I pour myself a cup, and put the rest to a `Thermos` for work.
