The worst part of the day for me is definitely when I have to get up.

Waking up, that I can handle. But getting up? That, I hate.

The covers I have on my bed are heavy mostly beacause I have a `comfortor as well as a blanket`.

I sleep with two pillows which for some reasons have different color `pillowcase`. Well, at least the sheets match.

I sometimes wake up before the alarm goes off.

I like to keep the alarm `at a low volume`, with some classical music, nothing too `jarring`.

My old roommate used to like the terrible `buzzer` that you find on most alarm clock `nowadays` which always used to `drive me nuts`.

As I was saying, I sometimes wake up before the alarm, usually because some noise outside the house. 

A car door `slamming`, an alarm going off, gunfire, well, okay, not gunfire, but man, is my `neighborhood` noise.

Of course when I'm staying in the hotel, It's usually easier to just get a wake up call from the hotel than set the alarm. 

`I'm not really a early riser`, so I don't jump out of the bed ready to take on the world, I get up very slowly, usually one foot on the follow a time.

Every once in awhile I'll oversleep but not too often. I really love the weekends when I can sleep in.
