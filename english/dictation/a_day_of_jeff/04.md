I go back into my bedroom and `open up` my closet door. I have about 30 `dress shirts`, 10 pairs of pants, a `half-dozen` ties and some sweaters, `suit jackets` and `t-shirts`. I pull out `a clean pair of socks` and underwear, and then decide which shirt I'm going to wear today. 

I am terrible about `color coordinating`, so I usually bring my wife in at this point to help match my shirt and pants. 

I put on my `belt with the silver buckle` and `polish my shoes`.

I put my cellphone and car key in my front packet, and my wallet to the back one.

I put on my glasses and check myself in the mirror to make sure I look okay, and then I go into the home office to get my bag.

I used to carry `a more traditional briefcase`, but now I just use computer bag to hold my `laptop` and my papers.

Now I get back into the kitchen to grab my Thermos on the way out the door.

I lock the door and then hurry to my car in the `garage`.

`I'm usually running late` and today is no exception.
