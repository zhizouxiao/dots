I go into my bath `sometime around 6:45 am`. My sink and my medichine cabinet are on the left when you enter my bathroom. The `toliet` is next to that, with the tub in front. Anyway, I turn on the lights, and try to find the `mouthwash` in the `medicine` cabinet.

I pour `a small amount` into a cup, `swish` around for about 30 seconds, `gargle`, and `spit`.

Not pleasure, but necessary. Then I get out the floss. When I am done `flossing`,

I pull out the `toothbrush and toothpaste`. I brush and then it's off to the shower.

I `pull the shower curtain to aside`, step into the tub and pull the curtain back.

I turn on both the hot and the cold water, looking for the perfect temperature. 

I `lather up` with the `soap`, put some `shampoo` in my hair, then `rinse` and dry off.

Now it's shaving time. I used to own `an electric razor`, but I found it didn't shave close enough. So I'm back to the old hand razor. I lather up with the `shaving cream`, and I start to shave. I rinse the razor and throw the `disposable blades` in the trash.

It's about 7 am, and I am on to breakfast.
