With the dinner dishes done, my wife and I each sit down on the couch to `chill out`, and watch the national news, which comes on at 6:30.

During the newcast, I sort through the day's mail. 
Most of it is junk mail and bills.
There are also serveral fliers for hourses for sale in the area.

I check the `front stoop` and see that there are no packages.

I like to watch TV and my wife likes to watch `reality shows`. One thing I hate is having to watch all of the `commercials`, so I turn the sound down when they come on.

After the show is over, I thumb through the latest issue of the Atlantic Monthly, while my wife reads a novel by her favorite mystery writer.

At around 9, I remember that tomorrow is trash day, so I take the kitchen garbage out and dump the recycling bins as well. I roll the trash container out to the street ready for the garbage trucks, which come by early in the morning.
