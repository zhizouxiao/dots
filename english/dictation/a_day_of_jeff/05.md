I open my car door and throw my briefcase in the `back seat`, and get comfortable for my drive. 

I put the `coffee mug` into the cup holder, put the keys in the `ignition`, find the `gas pedal` and start the car.

My wife drove the car last night, so I have to `re-adjust` the `rear view mirror and the side mirrors`.

I turn on the radio to listen to the drive time traffic report. 

I take the transmission out of the park, and into reverse, back out into the driveway into the street, close the garage door, and put the car into drive.

I used to drive a stick shift, but as I get older, I like my automatic transmission more and more.

I ususally take the freeway into the office, so I get on the onramp for the freeway and drive to where I have to get off.

my office is only a few miles from the exit.

I pull into the parking garage, swiping my key card to get in. I park, grab my briefcase and coffee, and head toward the elevator. And that only took 40 minutes.
