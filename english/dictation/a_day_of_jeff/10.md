At 10:30, I decide to get ready for bed. When I was little, my mother would read me a bedtime story. I'm looking forward to having that `ritual` with my own kids someday.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the tap. I wash my face, and dry it with my towel.

I floss and brush my teeth. I have to admit that by this time, I'm beat, and so is my wife.

She cleans up when I've finished up.

In the meantime, I walk into the bedroom and get undressed. I put my dirty clothes in the `hamper` and I put on my `pajamas`. Wearing my slippers, I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water to put next to the bed in case I need it during the night. I pull back the covers, `fluff my pillow`, and climb into bed. I set my alarm clock for 6:15, and turn off the overhead light. I lay my head down and pull up the covers, kissing my wife goodnight. Some nights I have trouble falling asleep, but
tonight, I didn't need to count any sheep. I nod off right away and before long, I'm fast asleep.
