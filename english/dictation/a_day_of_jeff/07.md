It's 5 o'clock, and it's quiting time. I put a few files into my bag, `grab my mug`, and say goodbye to `the rest of the people` in my area.

I go to the parking garage and get into my car.

I `signal my turn onto the street`, and drive to `the freeway onramp`.

I merge as best as I can onto the freeway, which always `a bit of a hassle` at this hour.

Traffic is stop-and-go all the way from downtown.

I hear on the radio that there's a stalled car in fast lane near La Brea, `backing up traffic` all the way to Hoover.

I decide to get off the freeway, and to `take surface streets for` the rest of the trip.

I need to make a stop on the way home. I know that the fridge is empty, so I decide to stop by the market.

I get there and I pick up some French bread, a bag of apples, a few bananas, some paste, tomato sause and a cooked chicken. 

Luckily they have a lot of checkout stands open, and I get through the line pretty quickly.

I thank `the cashier and the bagger` and push my `cart` to my car.

I open the track and load everything up. Just then my wife call me on my cellphone.

She was going to be a little late getting home and asks me to make something for dinner. 

Tonight I will be the cook.
