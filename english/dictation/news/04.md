surgeon
in our hands
There comes a moment where it's more than just a game
you either take that step forward, or turn around and walk away.

```
end of residency
operating table
boundaries
drawing lines in the sand
praying like hell no one crosses them
```

```
the code team
sutures
resident
whining
staffed
deliver
scalpel
```

```
cocky 
arrogant
bossy
pushy
God complex
I am not done
```

coma
