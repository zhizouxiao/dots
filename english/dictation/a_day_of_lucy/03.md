In the **kitchen****,** the first thing I do is pour myself a cup of coffee and I add a **skim** milk and suger. my roommate usually **make a pot** when she wakes up for both of us, since she gets up first.


I **go the fridge** to take out the eggs. When I have time, I'd like to cook a hot breskfast, so I take out my **frying** span, **pour** a little oil in it, and turn on the **front burner** on the stovetop. while the eggs are cooking, **I put two pieces of bread into the toaster**. When the eggs are nice and brown on
the edges, I use a **spatula** to put them on a plate. Some mornings, I have to **settle for some cold cereal or just toast with jam**, but it's nice to start the day with a sit-down meal when I get the chance.


When I'm done, I take my plate and my **silverware** to the sink, where my roommate has left her breakfast dishes. Since she makes the coffee in the morning, I wash the dishes. It's a pretty good **arrangement**. I put a little **dishwashing detergent** on the **sponge**, **scrub** the dishes, and leave them in the **drying rack** to dry.
