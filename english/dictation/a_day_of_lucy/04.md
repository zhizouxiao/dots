I go back to my bathroom to finish doing my hair. Before I put **the hot curlers** in, I had put **a little gel in my hair to give it some volume**. I also like to use my **hairdryer** to give my **bangs** a little more shape.
I take out the curlers one by one and brush through them into the style I like. I **finish it off** with a little **hairspray** and I'm ready to get dressed.

In my bedroom I look in my **closet** for a skirt and a **blouse** to match. The office I work in is pretty **casual** so I don't need to wear **a suit** to work. On Fridays, we are allowed to be even more casual so most people wear jeans and **sweaters** to the office, but no one **dares to** show up in T-shirt and shorts.


I put on the skirt and blouse and open the top of **dresser drawer** to get some **pantyhose**. I wish I could wear my tennis shoes to work, but I pick out a pair of heels and put them on. I was really to go.
