I like my job, but it takes over an hour to get there from my part of town.First, I walk three blocks to the subway station and **swipe** my monthly pass to get through the turnstile. I wait on the platform for the first **express train**. I get on and since it's so **crowded** during the morning hours, there aren't any seats and I stand, holding onto a (handrail). At my stop, I get off, **transfer** to my second train that will get me to Union Station. This one isn't as **crowded** and I manage to find a seat. 


When the train gets to Union Station. I get off the train, go up the stairs, and go
out of the front exit to the bus stop. I get on the B bus to downtown and show my bus pass to the bus driver. I sit down near the front of the bus and when three more people get on board, the diver **starts on the route**. when we get close to my stop, I press the button to signal to the driver that I need to get off and the bus puts up to the next stop. I get off and walk half a block to the building where I work. 


it's a long `commute`, but I look around every morning and I see that I am not the only one who has to do it.
