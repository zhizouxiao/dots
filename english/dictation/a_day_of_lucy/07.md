I left work at exactly 5:00, because I wanted to make it to the bank before it closed at 5:30. `Fortunately`, it is on the way to bus stop. I get to the bank and I stand in line. I fill out a `deposit` `envelope` and sign on the back of my paycheck while I wait my turn. When I get to the front of the line, I hand the `teller` the envelope and I ask her if she could tell how much I had in my account? She told me my balance and handed me the `receipt`. 


I ride the bus and the subway home. I `realize` I need a few things `at the market` and stop at one on the way there. I pick up a `cart` as soon as I walk in and go to the `produce department` to `load up on fruit`, some apples and bananas.I look around to see what kind of cooked foods they have. I'm feeling lazy and I don't want to cook tonight. I pick up a `sandwich` and `head for` the checkout stands. I get into the shortest line and the cashier rings me up.  she gives me my change and the bagger hands me my bags. I work the two blocks to my apartment and I am ready for a relaxing evening at home.
