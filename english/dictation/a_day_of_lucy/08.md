when I `get home`, I `change into` my casual clothes and `head for` the kitchen. I grab my sandwich, a `napkin`, and sit down at the dining room table to eat.


For my birthday last year, my brother gave me some `place mats` that have maps of the United State on them. I've always been bad at `geography` so he thought it would be funny to give me something to study while I ate. Of course, I haven't learned a thing.

I'm still hungry after the sandwich and want some `dessert`. I preheat the oven and then take a package of `ready-made` cookies out of the `fridge` that just needed to be baked. I get out a `cookie sheet`, put some `aluminum foil` on it. I always do this on when I bake because this way I don't have to do any dishes afterwards. I could just throw away the foil. 


Then, I shape the `dough` into circles, put them on the cookie sheet and put the pan into the oven. After 15 minutes, I put on my oven `mitts` and take the pan out. The cookies smell great, but first, I need to let them cool. After 30 minutes, I put 3 of them on a plate and the rest of them on the Tupperware container. I'll take them to work tomorrow. That should make the day go by a little faster.
