I am feeling pretty `energetic` when I finish my 3 cookies and decide to do a little cleaning. I take out a `rag` and start `dusting` my living room. I dust the TV and the `lamps`. I `wipe the coffee` table too. the rag looked `filthy` so I get out the `vacuum` and `vacuum` it. I `pick up around the room` and put things away. The bathroom needs cleaning, too. By this time I am starting to feel tired. `Mopping` the bathroom floor and `scrubbing` the tub will have to `wait for another day`. 

I turn on the TV to watch the `newscast` but I missed the national news. I `flip though` the channels but all I see are `commercials`. My faviourite `reality` show doesn't come on for another hour so I turn off the TV. I put down the remote and pick up a `magazine`. I `thumb through` it for a few minutes, and then the phone rings. it's my best friend Marlene, so I put down the `magazine` and spend the half hour chatting with her. `There's nothing like` a good talk with a good friend to end the busy day.
