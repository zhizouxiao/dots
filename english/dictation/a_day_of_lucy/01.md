On a weekday, I ***usually*** get up at ***around*** 6:30 a.m., but I set my alarm to ***go off*** at 6:20 so that I can hit the snooze button to sleep another 10 minutes. My roommate thinks I am ***crazy***, but doing this in the morining actually ***helps me wake up***. I am a night owl, not ***an*** early bird like she is. so I need extra few minutes to get going in the morning.   
One reason ***it's*** so hard to get up is because my bedroom and my bed is so comfortable.I ***splurged*** and bought a bed with a very soft, thick mattres. I also have matching sheets and pillowcases, and a ***comforter*** made of ***goose down***. Even my nightstand matches my sheet and the rest of my bed room. I ***decorated*** it so that it would be restful after a busy day of work.   
When I get up, the first thing I do is ***put on*** my ***robe***. it's always so cold in the apartment in the mornings, no master what time of year it is. Then, I usurally make my bed, I hated making my bed when I was little, but now it become a routine. Sometimes, though, I'm so tired that I sleep in for just a little too long and then, and then the bed definately does not get made. on those days, I wish I could sleep in all day.
