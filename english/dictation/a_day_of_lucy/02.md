I share a bathroom with my roommate, which **is usually** not a problem. We each try to keep the sink, the tub, and the toliet clean, and we have **separate** **medichine cabinets** to keep our things. There's also room under the sink for our **hairdryers** and **tampons**. 
    I start out by **rinsing my mouth** with some **mouthwash** before **flossing**. Then, I take out my **toothbrush and toothpaste** and brush my **teeth**. I only wash my hair every other day, so I put on a **shower cap**, and don't have to get out my **shampoo and conditioner**. I like to take **bubble baths** when I have time, but on a busy morning, a shower will have to do. I **lather up** quickly and **give my legs a quick shave**.
    I don't wear a lot of markup to work. so I just put on a little blush and a **light-colored lipstick**, and **skip the mascara and eye shadow**. I put a few **hot curlers** in my hair, and I'm ready for my breakfast.
