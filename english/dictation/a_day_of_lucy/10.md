I am feeling pretty tired by 11:00 and decide to get ready for bed. I go into the bathroom to take off my make-up. I use a cleanser to wash my face and dry it with a `towel`. Then I put some `toner` on my face and then some `moisturizer`. I `comb` my hair and tie it back. I don't like getting hair in my face while I sleep so tying it back helps. I floss and brush my teeth, and am `ready for bed`. By this time, I'm pretty beat.

I go into my bedroom and get undressed. I put the dirty clothes in the `hamper` and put on my `pajamas`. I take off my `slippers` and pull back the covers. I check my alarm to make sure it's on and then I lay down. I have the same `ritual` every night which I think helps me `fall asleep` more easily. It's not long before I'm fast asleep.
