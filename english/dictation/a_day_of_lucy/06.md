I get to the office and sit down `at my desk`. I share a `cubicle` with another employee, Jim, but he only work in the afternoons so we don't usually get in each other's way too much.I boot up my computer and look up my `agenda` for today. I had about 30 new emails in my inbox but I decide not to read them right away. There were some new inter-office `paperwork` in my inbox too, but I decide to look at them a little later. First I wanted to `start in` on a report that I have to finish today. I had a `conference` call at the end of the day with the head office. but I had most of day to get it done. 

`Before long`, it was `the lunch hour`. I didn't pack a lunch so I ask my `supervisor` if she wanted to have lunch together. We head down the street to a `sit-down restaurant`. The `hostess` shows us to a table `in the back of` the restaurant. The waiter arrives a few minutes later and we order `entrees`, no `appetizers`, since we need to get back `by 1 o'clock`. The waiter was very busy so I had to wave him down to get the check. He brought the bill and my `supervisor` and I `split` the check. we walk back to the office and I get back to the work just four more hours until `quitting` time.
