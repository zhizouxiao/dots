A: Nick! How is it going?

B: Oh, `Hey`.

A: What are you doing in this `neighborhood`? do you live around here?

B: `Actually` my office is right around the corner.

A: It was great to meet you last week at the `conference`, I really enjoy our conversation about `foreign investment`.

B: Yeah, yeah, it's pretty interesting. You know, I am `in a bit of hurry`. but here is my card. We should `definitely` meet up again and continue our discussion.

A: Sure, you still have my `contact details` right?

B: You know what? this is really `embarrassing`, but your name has just `slippd my mind`.Can you remind me?

A: Sure. My name is Ana Ferris. Don't worry about it; it happens to me all the time. I'm terrible with names too.
