A: I can believe it took us two hours to get there. The traffic in New York is unbelievable.

B: Yeah, but just relax honey, we are here and we're going on a `vacation`. In a few hours we'll be in `Hawaii`, and you'll be on the golf course.

A: Look at that line! It must be a mile long. There is no way I am waiting another two hours.

B: Honey...... don't.

C: Hey, man... the end of the line is over there. 

A:yeah...

C:No, seriously, I was here first, you can't `cut in line` like this.

A:Says who?

C: I do.

A: so sue me.

C:Alright...that's it....
