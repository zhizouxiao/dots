A: Like I told you before, we just don't have the `resources` to hire you an `assistant`.

B: I understand that, but the fact is we're `understaffed`.

A: The timing is just not right. The `economy` is bad, and it's too risky to take on new `staff`.

B: Yeah, I guess you are right.Here is `an idea`. what if we hire `an intern`? She `would` take some of the weight off my shoulders.

A: she?

B: Yeah, you know, a recent graduate. She could `give me a hand with` some of these projects and we could keep our `costs` down.

A: That sounds reasonable, Let me see what I can do.
Tony, Let me `introduce you to` your new assistant.

B: OK, great. Let's meet her!

A: Hi, I'm Adam.

B: Hi, I'm Tony.
