A: Oh great! This stupid computer `froze` again. It's the third time today. Hey, Sanail, can you come and take a look at my pc. it's `acting up` again.
it must have a `virus` or something.

B: Just give me a second, I'll be right up.

I `ran` a virtus scan on your computer and it turns out that you have a lot of `infected` files.

A: But I'm quit careful when I'm browsing the internet. I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.

B: Well, you have to make sure that your `anti-virus` software is updated regularly; yours wasn't up to date, that's probably what was causing your problems.

A: Ok, anything else?

B: Yeah, Try not to kick or hit the computer.

A: Yeah, sorry about that.
