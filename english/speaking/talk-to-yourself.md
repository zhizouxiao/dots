1. Learn to think in English.
    - if you speak to yourself in English, you will slowly begin to think more in English.

2. Make it personal
    - part1, it is really about who you are, what you do and where you are from.
    - part2, it is about your experience, people you know and places you have been to.
        1. look around you and talk about what you see. "What is it?" "where did you get it?" "why is it special?"
        2. go through your photos and think about people, places and experiences. "who are they?" 
        "how long have you known them?" "where is it?" "what happend?" "who else was there?" "Why do you remember it?"
    - part3, it is about what you think about some issues - your opinions. 
        1. everytime you read something, you simply try and summarise the main point and say to yourself whether you agree with it.
        2. it can add your vocab, you will natrually use some of the words you have just read.

3. Improve yor vocabulary
    - You learn words by using them and every time you say a word, you are that much closer to really knowing it.
    - force yourself to keep speaking, you will need phrases like "What I'm trying to say is..." "What I mean is..."

4. time yourself- improve your fluency and coherence
    - Look at a photo and try and talk about it for 3 minutes
    - then 2 minutes
    - 1 minutes
    - 30 seconds

5. Record yourself - how do you sounds?
