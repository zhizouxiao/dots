1. I had my hair cut in the same way. 
2. I ate hot pot with my friends at lunch. I realised there are not common topics between them and I. So I left the table early. Everyone has their lives to live. I am trying hard to live my life I want.
3. I can't sleep at night because I sleep one hour in the afternoon. So I continue to read the book. Reading English book can help me to fall asleep. It's a truth from practise.
4. There are a lot of mosquitoes in the living room. It's ready annoying. Why do I sleep in the living room? Because my roommate snores at night recently, and I can't sleep with it. After two nights, I am sure I can't bear it.
