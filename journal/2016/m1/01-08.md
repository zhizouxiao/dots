There was nothing special happened today. I commuted to work by bike as usually. It was really cold this week. 
I think these days are the coldest days in the whole year. I needed to finish some work in case of working 
overtime at the weekend. Luckily I have finished all my work before getting off the work. 

These was a simple work costed me more than two hours. I think the problem is that my colleague and I can't work 
together efficiently. I can't check the interacting part of work with others immediately, so If there is a mistake 
in others' work, I have the pay the time for it. I will find a way to improve it next week.

Besides, I want to focus on improving my skills in career when I am in company. Learning English is a long time plan,
so is my career. They are both important to my life. I can't lose in neither of them.
