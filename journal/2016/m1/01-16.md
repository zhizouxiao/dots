I got up at 5:30 am in the morning to learn driving. If it went well, I could get my driving license before the Spring Festival. My coach today was a very talkative person. In my opinion, a talkative person is usually friendly. The four hours of class was over soon. At last, the coach told me to submit the learning log which is necessary to reserve the third term of driving exam. 

I took the shuttle back home as usual. As soon as I arrived home, I fall asleep, since I suffered from lack of sleep in recent days. I woke up since someone called in. I struggled to get up but still missed the call. When I wanted to go back to sleep, LiuSi arrived. She looked beautiful today. After a singing show and a old good movie, we decided to go to her apartment. It's a long way, we finally arrived at 10pm.
