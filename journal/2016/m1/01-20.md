I'm still working on the vim and the weather is still cold. There are plenty of
things need to learn, if I want to be an expert with vim. I set my goal of
learning vim which was publishing an article of my learning experience. 

I was noticed that I was about to transfer to another team of my company,
which made me think a lot. I got a lot of things on my list. I had to
think about my career and my English learning plan. Plus, I planed to
travel to Tibet next year. I don't want to drop any of my plans. However,
I don't have time to finish them all. My plans are as follows:
1. I need to work for my career both domestic and aboard.
2. I need to past the IELTS exam so that I can get the chance to work
   aboard.
3. I do want to work like a gamer and learn everything related of being
   a gamer.
4. I want to travel, which is not a big goal. But I don't want to forget my
   traveling spirit.

I am still can not figure out how to deal with all the things. What I know is
focus on the most important things and enjoy my life.
