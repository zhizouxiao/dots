New year has come, however, I don't share the happiness with others. I feel a great pressure at my 26.
Many of my friends have gotten married, but I'm still single. I'm not satisfied with my current state, 
I want to change it and I have lots of things to do.


I have taken my English class today. My teacher today is a very kind girl. I told my teacher about my 
pressure from the others. She gave some advises to cheer up. The first one is I should enjoy our life and 
find a way to relax. Then, thinking things I have done instead of the unfinished plans. and she suggested me 
to smile more. "sad makes you old" she said. Then I finished our class as usual. 


Actually, I know all these methods. I believe a good mood of me must from something I have finished or I 
have made a great progress in my plan. If I stay alone and do nothing, the loneliness and the worry about
my future will always be with me. I hope I can be brave as the ideal myself. Keep searching, never settle.
