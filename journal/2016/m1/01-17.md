we got up really late in the morning. we didn't plan before. Since it snowed outside, I preferred to stay at home. I taught LiuSi a method to download the e-books online and I shared my kindle account with her. I recommend a few books to her I really like.

We had the dumplings bought yesterday for lunch. After lunch, we wanted to watch a movie but we don't have too much choices, so I picked a comedy which I had watched two times. It's a really good movie, but I fall asleep in the middle of it at this time. 

I shared some English songs with LS. She download them to her phone. She like to listen songs when she is on her way to anywhere. At the same time she is a good singer too.

I practised my oral English with my application for about half an hour.

We went out to buy some food materials for dinner. LS finished cooking for about half an hour. I'm really glad to know she is a good cook now.
