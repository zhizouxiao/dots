I took a day off today, so this is my first workday this weekend. I got plenty of work to do. I arranged my work of this week, got to know the code of this project and tried to run the code. In the afternoon, I got the rights to access the client code, but I couldn't build and run the code which it's because the version of my mac system was too low. Then I had to change my computer. If I start to use a new computer, I have to install lots of software. Tomorrow will be a super busy day.

I realized one big problem of my English is that I don't have enough vocabulary to express myself.
After I had super, I tried to find how to add my vocabulary. The answers were more or less similar. I need to read as much as possible and use new words to speak or write. A detailed plan is necessary.
