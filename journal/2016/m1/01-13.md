These days are really chill. However, the air pollution is better becasue of the big wind.
I can see the blue sky and white clouds again.

I was busy all day around, because the game testing process was on. So I had to fix bugs 
and developed new feature at the same time. Luckily I finished all my tasks before knocking off. 

I tried to eat my dinner as fast as I can, so that I could make it to my English class at night.
The class started as usual and my current teacher was friendly. I could tell she was a execllent 
teacher because she was patient to me, correted all my mistakes and gave me suggestions for my daily 
learning. I liked this teacher.

I feel tired now. I wanted to go to bed right now.
