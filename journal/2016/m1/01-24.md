I went to learn driving school in the morning. Today I did a special training before the exam. There are 4 people shared a car with me, so everyone can only drive a round in the whole morning. I was the first one did the exercise, then I waited for the shuttle back to driving school. I couldn't wait for the round in the afternoon. 

When I was waiting for the shuttle in the resting room for students. I met a guy who was a programmer like me and I graduated 2 years early than him. He is very active person and he wants to build his own app. 

When I arrived home, Ying was watching movie and other roommates went shopping. I joined with her to the movie. The movie was not attractive so she quited watching in a few minutes. After that, I started watching videos on Youtube. I was obsessed with a stand-up show. The host's name is Russell Peters. This guy is comedy genius. I really like his show.
