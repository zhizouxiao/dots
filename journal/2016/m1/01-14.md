Our game will be published in 4 channels together, so I and my colleagues have to work overtime. Maybe I will spend the whole night here.Actually I don't have to so much work to do, I just wait for some bugs happening.

I cannot take my English class tonight, so I canceled my class when I had my dinner. Learning English is very important for me now, I don't want to miss any chance to speak English. 

In the morning I suddenly realize that I am not a expert with anything. I like to try new things and I think it's my advantage, however, I can't make it to the end. I think I need a change right now. First, I will make some plans starting from small things as follows:
1. be good at using VIM and emacs.
2. refine my website and make it expert level.
3. be good at using TMUX. Create a project for every thing I'm working on.
