Since I will go to another team, I decide to stop learning cocos2dx. I will add Unit3D to my learning plan. Unit3D will be my major learning item in the next year. If it goes well, I might change my major in programming. This is a big decision for my career.

I have learned vim for several days. I think I have known most parts of it. I know I can't be an export at once, so I leave it. I will focus on the emacs as the main editor. I heard nothing but praise about it. In order to pick it up, I need to learn lisp, which is functional programming language. I have never learn a language like that, so I think it would be fun.

Since I will start a new project, I want to sum up what I've learned in the last project and apply them to the new project. The most important thing is learning how to use TDD in the new project. I have so much to learn about it.
