It's much warmer today. I past the third item of driving exam today. I didn't know how to operate the light and I did many wrong operations when I drove in the exam. I was really nervous. Anyway the examiner let me pass the exam.

After I finished my exam, I realized there was no shuttle available until 5:15 pm. A girl suggested to call a taxi with me, so there were four people taking the taxi. We shared the bill. 

The two girls took taxi with me haven't graduated from university. Their major is English. I was so lucky, because one of them had past the IELTS exam. I asked her for some advise about how to learn English. She was a very helpful girl, so I got a lot of advise. 

1. start from several topics and then expand the content of each topic.
2. how to distinguish similar words. There are many books about that.
3. how to write complex sentences? Read the model answers and collect the complex sentences one by one.
4. set a goal and fight for it.

She gave me the confidence of passing the IELTS exam. I am sure I'll pass the exam this year.
