It's very cold today, the temperature was ten degrees blow zero in the morning. I arrived at company 1.5 hour early. So I did the best choice and took a nap first. 

After I woke up, I continue to learn the spacemacs and added some knowledge about the vim. I needed to go through the document of spacemacs and finished a book of vim. These were my recent goals. I wanted to be an vim expert and spacemaces expert. I know I had a lot of things to learn, but I have the confident.

I wanted to learn cocos2dx at the same time. My board plan was getting familiar with the grammar of cpp and learn the basic knowledge of cocos2dx, at last, started a project of my own.

After knocking off, I had dinner with my friend Kai. Then I went back to company and took my  English class online. The network condition was very bad today, however, I wanted to take another class to decide if I should take class in my company.
