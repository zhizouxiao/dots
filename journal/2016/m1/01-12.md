We had a good time last night. We valued our lefting time together. We stayed very late before falling asleep. 

In the morning, she cooked me noodles. It was delicious. Then we went to work together and seprated in the subway station.

This was the last time we met each other for sure. I gave my best wishes to her in my heart.
