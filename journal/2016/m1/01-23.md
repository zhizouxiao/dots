I slept very late last night, because this was the first Saturday I was free at home. I was very busy and tired in the weekend recently. I need to get up at 5:30am every weekend to go to the driving school and sometimes I had to work overtime. At that time I can only sleep 5 hours a night. 

I got up at 8:30 am. This is the latest morning I get up this year. I started watching the book in my phone. 

Ying's boyfriend slept over last night and he boiled the mutton soup for us. I think he did it to make up to us. because I got a kind of skin disease from I born so I can't eat mutton. 

It's freezing outside, so we wanted to eat hotpot at lunch. But we can't buy enough food material since the cold weather. At last, we decided to eat outside.
