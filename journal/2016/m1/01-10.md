LiuSi and I got up at 7am, and we needed to arrive at the subway station where 
a bus was waiting for us. We were on time but there was a girl who was late.
she is already on her way here so the team leader decided to wait for her.

It took us almost 2 hours to the destination, where we started hiking.
We went along the river among the mountains. The river is beautiful. The ice on 
the river was really clear. It seemed you stand on the river without any help.
