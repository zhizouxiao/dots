Liu is going to Lijiang City, which is in the south of China. She told me about that this morning and she wanted to meet me at the last time.
Since she dumped me two years ago, I only have met her a few times. I don't know how to face her and I don't know if I'm still in love with her.
I think I was very brave to chase after her when we were in the college and she had a boy friend. 

We spent some time to plan our last weekend. At the very beginning, I thought a decent meal would be just okay. It was a simple but direct plan.
However, she wanted to have a trip in the countryside around Beijing. Because I had never said no to her, so I did some research about the route 
and lodging at the noon. Finally I made the decision to go hiking with a trip team. It's very convinent to go with a team, because we don't need 
to worried about our route.Despite my complex mood, I am really looking forward to our trip.
