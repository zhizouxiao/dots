I went to learn driving in the morning. It was a sunny day which is rare in Beijing nowadays.
I learned a new driving lesson, which is driving on the real road under the supervise 
of the coach. I felt the simple pleasure of driving for the first time. Speed is the 
core part of driving.

After my driving class, I went to pick up my friend LiuSi. She would come over to my 
apartment for the hiking plan next day. We watched two or three moives then, but they are all
very bad. I couldn't finish them. I was really tired because I staied awake for the whole night, which
 is because I ate a pill. I thought it was good for my health. After we watched the movies we
 went out for dinner. I wanted to treat her, but she wanted to pay the bill. I couldn't 
 change her mind like always. We stopped by the the supermarket and bought some food for the hiking tomorrow.
