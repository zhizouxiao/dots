LiuSi will work in Lijiang city in Yunnan Province, so she asked me out to reunion last weekend. We had a good 
time in our trip, but we didn't talk about the separation. It was clear that that's our last meet. 

LiuSi is a very emtional person. She said she had some words to tell me this afternoon. I was in the company, 
she has been waiting outside the subway station near my home. LiuSi had sitten in the chill wind for about one
hour when I met her. She didn't say a word after I met her. She was crying and I didn't know how to comfort her 
as before. She was very upset about this separation, I could feel the same way but I didn't show it. Then she 
started to blame me for refusing her invitation. She wanted to cook for me, but I said no to her. She said 
I was heartless and I had no feeling with her. However, It's definatly wrong, meeting her and leaving her was 
a torture to me. I loved her so much 3 years ago.

After she settled down, she asked me to send her home. I couldn't refuse her twice in a day.
