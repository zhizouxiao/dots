Today I officially moved to the other team. We started to develop a new game. It's a copy of Clash of Kings. There are literally the same game. I spent my whole afternoon reading the documents of the game and I downloaded "Clash of King" as soon as I finished moved to my new work position. I know if I want to develop a game, the first step is definitely knowing how to play it. Then I was obsessive about it. I could help opening it again and again to finish the tasks in the game. 

Luckily I found the software Unity3D in my new team, then I installed it in both of my computer. My leader wanted me to evaluate the time to develop some features of the game, so I didn't have time to finished an example of Unity3D.

When I was about to leave, the art girl asked me if I wanted to join them to eat Kebab together. I refused her, mostly because I am not a big fan of Kebab and I was pretty sure this girl had a boy friend. Besides, it's freezing outside, I wanted to go back home immediately.
