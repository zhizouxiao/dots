I worked overtime to 2 am in the morning. When I arrived home, it's about 3 am. I was so tired and hungry so that I fell asleep immediately. I woke up at 9 am. 

After I went back to work, I felt like I was a zombie. In the rest time of today, I only did a few things. I refined the process of changing configure files, so that my colleague could upload one file at a time. I continued to learn the tool called "spacemacs". It was pretty hard to understand at first, I even could understand the documents. But after I did some research and questioned some questions, I finally I could get the main meaning of it. If I can be the expert of it, there were many documents to read and many works to do. I left it at here because I was really tired. 

LS messaged me she would come and have dinner with me. I took her to a noodle restaurant which had the authentic noodle of XiAn city. After dinner, she mentioned she wants to visit my home in the afternoon. We walked for a few minutes and had small talk. At last, She headed back to her home, while I had to go back to my company, work overtime again.
