I did a really stupid thing today, I rade to work in the morning, which turned out to the bigest mistake I made this year. It's freezing outside, and I forgot to wearing my headphone. I used to use my headphone to keep my ear warm.

It's very peace in the work place, since we worked overtime for a few days. Everyone was tired and didn't want to do anything even talking. My friends were off the work in the morning. I refined the packaging script to avoid getting the same version. It spent me more than an hour, because I was not familar with shell programming language. 

I continued learnning to be a expert of vim and emacs. I wanted to learn the original emacs tomorrow, because there are more documents in emacs. It's natrual to learn from start. My vim plugin about autocompleting didn't work very well so I dived in and wanted to find out what's going wrong. I compared PYCHARM, an Python IDE, with vim plugin, and I found there were no big difference between them. If I could custom the vim plugin, it could be better than IDE. I downloaded the
cocos2dx project from github and I am going to explore some game samples.
