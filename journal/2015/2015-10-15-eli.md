Work:
1. We are in the second stages of our game improvement. Some requirements are changed and some features are added. All things done is to pass the last review of Tencent, which is the largest game publish platform.
2. Some new features added in the game has some side effects in the original logic. So my target is the reorignise the code to face the furture change. Then I debug the changed parts with a colleague.

Life:
1. I did 25X3 push-ups.
2. I started read the book named "the little women".
